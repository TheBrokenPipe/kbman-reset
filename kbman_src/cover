ABSTRACT

B is a computer language intended for recursive, primarily nonnumeric applications typified by system programming.  B has a small, unrestrictive syntax that is easy to compile.  Because of the unusual freedom of expression and a rich set of operators, B programs are often quite compact.

This manual contains a concise definition of the language, sample programs, and instructions for using the PDP-11 version of B.
